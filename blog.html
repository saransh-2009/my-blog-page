            <p>
                When deciding on a career path, one of the biggest choices students face is between commerce and science. 
                Both fields offer numerous opportunities and have their own unique benefits. Here's a closer look at both:
            </p>

                <strong>Commerce:</strong> This stream is ideal for students interested in business, economics, and finance. 
                Careers in commerce include accounting, marketing, and entrepreneurship. 
                The skills learned in commerce are practical and applicable in the real world, making it a versatile choice.

            <p>
                <strong>Science:</strong> This field is perfect for those curious about the natural world and technology. 
                Careers in science include engineering, medicine, and research. 
                Science drives innovation and offers a chance to contribute to groundbreaking discoveries.
            </p>

                Ultimately, the choice between commerce and science depends on your interests and career goals. 
                Both streams offer rewarding opportunities and can lead to successful futures.
